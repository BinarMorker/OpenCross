// Room model textures as tiles.
//
// A room model draws from windows of its room's VRAM (import::vram_page_textures: the 256 x 256 texels from its TIM on, through CLUT rows
// clut_y and clut_y + 1) that also hold other models' art, so a page is no unit to dump or replace. The TILES are, per page, the texel
// rects its faces sample (overlapping rects merged, touching ones not) cut through that page's CLUT: dumped and replaced one by one and
// content-named (room_model/tile_<hash8>.png: the same art is ONE file across rooms and models). A page with replaced art is re-composed into
// assets::ModelAsset::mod_textures: enlarged (nearest) to the largest replacement scale, each replacement pasted over its rect (the UVs are
// normalised, so the faces sample the same places).
//
// A room model whose own TIM (the top-left of page 0) is a field character's RDE texture (FieldCharacterArt) IS that character (party members
// placed as room models in scenes): that region draws the character's art - its model/fieldobj/player/<n>/<n>/clut0.png replacement, or in
// the Modded art mode its hd.dat 4x texture - and its tiles are not dumped (the field character's own file holds them).
