// Tile library of a stage-like asset (battle stage, title scene, room effect meshes).
//
// The PS1 scenes sample (colour mode, CLUT) atlases of a VRAM area. bake_object_textures() cuts every texel rect the faces sample (rects that overlap merge;
// neighbours stay separate) out of the atlases - through their own CLUT, so plain RGBA - into TILES, de-duplicated by exact pixel content (size + RGBA incl.
// alpha) within the asset. The tile is the unit that is dumped and replaced. Every object (part) still draws ONE texture: its tiles shelf-packed with a 1-texel
// edge-extended gutter, with the part's UVs remapped to it. At load the tiles' replacements (mods) are applied and the object images are re-composed at the
// largest scale among their tiles (apply_tile_textures / recompose_object_textures).
